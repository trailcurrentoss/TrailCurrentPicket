# High-Level Design (HLD) Document

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Title:** Picket Module

**Description:** A microcontroller-based system that monitors the status of doors and cabinets. It will be used to make the high level system contextually aware of which doors and or cabinets are currently open or closed.

**Objective:**
To design and implement a reliable, low-power, and cost-effective microcontroller-based system for door and cabinet status monitoring that can operate autonomously and send data over the CAN bus.

## 2. Microcontroller Selection

**Selected Microcontroller:**  
**ESP32C6**  
[Datasheet](https://documentation.espressif.com/esp32-c6_datasheet_en.pdf)

**Rationale for Selection:**  
- Power efficient and built in can transceiver.  
- Low price point and availability as MCU, Module, or small footprint dev board.  
- Low power consumption.  
- Strong ecosystem and development support.
